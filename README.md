## Getting started

1. Install using a package manager

    ```bash
    npm i --save vue-smart-suggest
    # or
    yarn add vue-smart-suggest
    ```

2. Import `SmartSuggest` and define suggestion trigger(s)

    ```ts
    import { SmartSuggest, Trigger } from 'vue-smart-suggest';

    const userMentionTrigger: Trigger = {
        char: '@',
        items: [{ value: 'Joe' }, { value: 'Jane' }],
    };
    ```

    \*minimal example, check Trigger type definition to see all options

3. Enhance a text area with `<SmartSuggest />`

    ```html
    <SmartSuggest :triggers="[userMentionTrigger]">
        <textarea />
    </SmartSuggest>
    ```

4. That's it, your textarea will show up suggestions as you type `@`!
